# CSIS200 Final Project F'16

This project counted as our final exam for *Software Tools for Physicists*, taught by [Matt Bellis](https://github.com/mattbellis/Siena-College-CSIS-200).  We used Monte Carlo to calculate the expected rainfall in a month given a set of conditions, as detailed in the report.
